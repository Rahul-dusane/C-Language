## Problem List

### Pointer-Based Array and String Operations

1. **Sort 1D Array Using Pointer**: A user-defined function to sort a 1D array using pointer manipulation.
2. **Sort 2D Array Using Pointer**: Sorts a 2D array through a function that uses pointers.
3. **Sum of 1D Array Elements**: Calculates the sum of all elements in a 1D array using a pointer.
4. **Sum of 2D Array Elements**: Calculates the sum of elements in a 2D array using pointer manipulation.
5. **String Comparison Using Pointer**: Compares two strings using pointers.
6. **String Concatenation Using Pointer**: Concatenates two strings without using standard library functions, using pointers instead.
7. **Palindrome Check for String Using Pointer**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome using pointers.
8. **String Copy Using Pointer**: Copies one string into another using pointers.
9. **Count Prime Numbers in 1D Array Using Pointer**: Counts prime numbers in a 1D array with pointers.
10. **Armstrong Number Check Using Pointer**: Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number using pointer logic.

### Array and String Reversal, Insert, Update, and Delete Operations

11. **Reverse 1D Array Using Pointer**: Reverses the elements of a 1D array using pointers.
12. **Reverse String Using Pointer**: Reverses a string using pointer manipulation.
13. **Insert, Update, and Delete in 1D Array Using Pointer**: Manages elements in a 1D array using pointers for insertion, updating, and deletion.

### Matrix Operations Using Pointer

14. **Matrix Operations Using Pointer**: 
    - Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and transposes matrices using pointer functions.

15. **Reverse 2D Array Using Pointer**: Reverses a 2D array using pointers.
16. **Count Vowels in a String Using Pointer**: Counts the number of vowels in a given string using pointers.

### Command-Line Argument Operations

17. **Display File Content Using Command Line Arguments**: Displays the content of a specified file using command-line arguments.
18. **Copy File Content Using Command Line Arguments**: Copies content from one file to another using command-line arguments.
19. **Calculate Factorial Using Command Line Arguments**: Calculates the factorial of a given number using command-line arguments.
20. **Prime Check Using Command Line Arguments**: Determines if a number is prime using command-line arguments.
21. **Sort Integers from Command Line**: Reads 10 integers from command-line input and displays them in sorted order.

### File Handling Operations

22. **Count Vowels and Consonants in `student.txt`**: Reads the `student.txt` file and counts the number of vowels and consonants.
23. **Sort Odd and Even Numbers into Separate Files**:
    - Reads integers from `master.dat`, writing odd numbers to `odd.dat` and even numbers to `even.dat`.
    - Includes a function to display the contents of each file.
24. **Count Records in `student.dat` File**: Reads and counts records in `student.dat` (structured as `{rollno, name, percentage}`).
25. **Merge Multiple Files into One**:
    - Reads `Student_info.txt`, `University_info.txt`, and `Bank_info.txt` and combines their content into `Student_details.txt`.
    - Also includes a function to display details from `details.txt`.

    - **File Contents**:
      - **Student_info.txt**: Contains student personal details (e.g., name, address, age, email).
      - **University_info.txt**: Contains university details.
      - **Bank_info.txt**: Contains bank information of the student.
