This repository contains C programs developed for Problem Sheet 1, focusing on data structure operations, recursive functions, pattern generation, and array manipulations. Each task provides hands-on practice with fundamental C concepts, including structures, arrays, and recursion.

## Problem List

### Structure-Based Programs

1. **City Census Management**:
   - Defines a structure `Census` with `city name`, `population`, and `literacy level`.
   - Reads details for 10 cities, sorts them alphabetically, by literacy level, and by population, and displays the sorted list.

2. **Cricket Team Management**:
   - Defines a `cricket` structure to manage player information (`Player name`, `Team name`, `batting average`).
   - Reads details for 20 players and prints a team-wise list with player names and averages.

3. **Hotel Directory**:
   - Defines a structure for `hotel` details, including `name`, `address`, `grade`, `average room charge`, and `number of rooms`.
   - Includes functions to filter hotels by grade, and to list hotels with charges below a specified value.

4. **Library Management System**:
   - Uses a `library` structure to hold `accession number`, `title`, `author`, `price`, and `issued` status.
   - A menu-driven program with options to add, display, search, and organize books.

### Function-Based Programs

5. **Leap Year Checker** - Function `leap(year)` checks if a year is a leap year.
6. **Sum of Digits** - Calculates the sum of digits in a number.
7. **Prime Number Checker** - Determines if a number is prime.
8. **Armstrong Number Checker** - Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.
9. **Factorial Calculation** - Returns the factorial of an integer.
10. **Array Sorter (1D)** - Sorts a 1D array in ascending and descending order.
11. **Array Sorter (2D)** - Sorts a 2D array in ascending and descending order.
12. **Largest & Smallest in 1D Array** - Finds the largest and smallest element in a 1D array.
13. **Largest & Smallest in 2D Array** - Finds the largest and smallest element in a 2D array.
14. **Age Calculator** - Takes birthdate as input and calculates age in years, months, and days (uses `date` structure).
15. **Date Validator** - Validates a user-input date.
16. **Date Comparison** - Compares two dates for equality using a structure.

### Time Structure and Operations

17. **Time Management**:
    - Defines a `time` structure with `hour`, `minute`, and `second`.
    - Functions include `Input()` for user input, `Display()` to show time, and `Validate()` to check validity.

### Array, Pattern, and Recursion Operations

18. **Prime Counter in 2D Array** - Counts prime elements in a 2D array.
19. **Fibonacci Series Generator** - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `N`.
20. **Sum of Digits** - Calculates the sum of digits in a given number.
21. **Sum of 2D Array Elements** - Calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array.
22. **Prime Checker** - Checks if a given number is prime.
23. **Armstrong Checker** - Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.
24. **Array Merging and Sorting**:
    - Reads two integer arrays, sorts them, merges them, and prints the sorted array.

25-26. **Pattern Generation**:
    - Functions to generate specific patterns for a given integer `N`.

27-30. **Recursive Functions**:
    - **Factorial Calculation** - Calculates factorial using recursion.
    - **Fibonacci Sequence** - Prints Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
    - **Integer Multiplication** - Multiplies two integers using recursion.
    - **Sum up to `N`** - Calculates the sum of numbers up to `N` using recursion.
    - **Power Calculation** - Computes the power of a number using recursion.
